Task 1
Copy the configuration file into current directory:

cp /usr/lib/ssl/openssl.cnf ./openssl.cnf 
create new sub-directories and files according to what it specifies in its [ CA_default ] section:

dir = ./demoCA # Where everything is kept
certs = $dir/certs # Where the issued certs are kept
crl_dir = $dir/crl # Where the issued crl are kept
new_certs_dir = $dir/newcerts # default place for new certs.
database = $dir/index.txt # database index file.
serial = $dir/serial # The current serial number
Simply create an empty file for index.txt, put a single number in string format in serial:

cp "/usr/lib/ssl/openssl.cnf" "/home/seed/PKI/"
mkdir demoWK
cd demoWK
mkdir certs crl newcerts
echo 1000 > serial
gedit index.txt
Start to generate the self-signed certificate for the CA:

# return to the parent directory
# cd ..
openssl req -new -x509 -keyout ca.key -out ca.crt -config openssl.cnf 
When asked to type PEM pass phrase, remember the password you typed (e.g. I use seeddes). It will then ask you to fill in some information, you can skip it by Enter, except for those required by policy_match.

Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase:
-----
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
